1️⃣ CRT Foundation Engine (Core Logic)
Reference Candle (CRT Candle)

A single candle (or defined group) whose range becomes the dealing range.

CRT Candle Types

5M CRT candle (most common)

15M CRT candle (stronger bias)

Session open candle

Displacement candle

CRT Range Data

CRT High

CRT Low

CRT Midpoint (50%)

CRT Range Size (pips / ATR multiple)

Candle direction (bull / bear)

Wick dominance (manipulation clue)

2️⃣ CRT Time-Based Rules (Non-Negotiable)
Valid CRT Windows

London Open

NY Open

Kill Zones

Post-liquidity raid candles

Invalid CRT Conditions

Low-volatility candles

Pre-Asia chop

News spike candles

Tiny ranges (below ATR threshold)

3️⃣ CRT Expansion Logic (The Edge)
Expansion Rules

Price must expand away from CRT range

Expansion direction defines bias

No trade inside CRT range

Expansion Validation

Candle close outside range

Displacement body > wick

Volume confirmation (relative)

4️⃣ CRT Models (Most Used in Real Trading)
🔹 Model 1: CRT Break & Expansion (Classic)

Rules

Identify valid CRT candle

Wait for break of high/low

Enter on continuation or retest

Targets

CRT range × 2–3

Liquidity pools

Session highs/lows

🔹 Model 2: CRT Manipulation → Expansion (High Probability)

Rules

Initial sweep of one side of CRT

Immediate reversal

Expansion in opposite direction

Dashboard Data

Sweep side

Reversal candle

Expansion confirmation

🔹 Model 3: CRT Premium / Discount Model

Rules

CRT midpoint defines equilibrium

Longs below 50%

Shorts above 50%

Entry on rejection candle

🔹 Model 4: CRT + FVG Confluence

Rules

CRT break creates FVG

Entry at FVG 50%

Target liquidity

🔹 Model 5: CRT Continuation Model

Rules

Trend already established

CRT forms during pullback

Expansion resumes trend

5️⃣ Liquidity Framework (CRT Style)
Liquidity Types

CRT high = buy-side liquidity

CRT low = sell-side liquidity

Equal highs/lows near CRT

Session liquidity alignment

Liquidity Events

Fake break (stop hunt)

Clean expansion

Failed expansion (no follow-through)

6️⃣ Multi-Timeframe CRT Alignment
TF	Role	Data
4H	Narrative	Draw on liquidity
15M	Bias	MSS / displacement
5M	CRT Formation	Reference candle
1M	Execution	Precision entry
7️⃣ Auto Entry Logic (CRT Engine)
Entry Types

Market entry on expansion

Limit entry on CRT retest

FVG-based entry after break

Entry Filters

HTF bias alignment

Session validity

Liquidity taken first

Range size acceptable

8️⃣ Stop Loss Logic (CRT-Specific)
SL Placement

Opposite side of CRT range

Beyond manipulation wick

Structure invalidation level

SL Enhancements

ATR buffer

Time-based stop (no expansion = exit)

9️⃣ Target Logic (CRT Precision)
TP Levels

CRT range projection (1R, 2R, 3R)

Opposing liquidity

PDH / PDL

Session highs/lows

Partial Scaling

TP1 at internal liquidity

TP2 at external liquidity

Runner for session expansion

🔟 CRT Confidence Score (AI-Based)
